The Worldwise project is one of my biggest react projects in my learning journey. This project utilizes the power of react router in building SPAs. So far I have learnt how to navigate to another page without having to reload the entire page. Also this project utilizes the great power of Context Api for state management along side Redux. I also learnt about CSS Modules for styling individual components. With CSS Modules you can style different components with the same className without having a clash, this is because react adds a unique id at the back of each class selectors which make it different from the other class selector with similar name. But with CSS Module we can still use a global styling for a component without having to import the styles, this can be done by wrapping the class selector inside the global function: :global(.nav){background-color: red}. This nav class selector will be accessible to all component because it has been made global by using the global function. This global function is usually, mostly important when we are working with some classes that are provided from external sources. Just like the active class provided by React router when we use NavLink. 
I moved all the states in the App component into a custom context provider. So I created a new folder which is a common practice
